This is a cloud detection method for Landsat 8/9 OLI/TIRS imagery  based on spectral and texture features, aiming to accurately and quickly detect cloud in polar regions without pre-training. 
We categorized the clouds into two types: normal clouds and cirrus clouds, and sequentially extracted them based on their differences in spectral features and texture features compared to snow.

Remember: you need to run Fmask first, obtain the Fmask image, and place it in the corresponding file path before you run this algorithm.
